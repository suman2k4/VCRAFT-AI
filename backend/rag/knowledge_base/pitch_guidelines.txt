## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Too Much Text

- Avoid jargon
- Make the pain tangible
- Use concrete examples

### 3. Made-Up Market Sizes
- Don't cite $1T markets
- Use credible sources
- Show bottom-up calculations
- Be realistic about your obtainable market

### 4. Ignoring Competition
- Saying "we have no competitors" is a red flag
- Show you understand the landscape
- Explain why incumbents won't crush you
- Highlight your unique advantages

### 5. Weak Team Slide
- Don't list generic skills
- Highlight relevant experience
- Show founder-market fit
- Explain why you'll win

### 6. Unrealistic Financials
- "We'll capture 1% of a $100B market" is lazy
- Build bottom-up projections
- Explain your assumptions
- Show you understand unit economics

### 7. No Clear Ask
- Be specific about funding needs
- Show how you'll use the money
- Explain the milestones you'll hit
- Make it easy for VCs to say yes
