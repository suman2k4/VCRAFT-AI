# Sequoia Capital - Framework for Evaluating Startups

## The Elements of Enduring Companies

Sequoia looks for companies that can endure and grow for decades. Key elements include:

### 1. Clarity of Purpose

The best companies have a clear mission that inspires employees and customers. Can you articulate why your company exists beyond making money?

Example: "We help small businesses compete with enterprises by democratizing access to technology."

### 2. Market Leadership Potential

We invest in companies that can become category leaders. This requires:
- Being in a large or rapidly growing market
- Having a unique insight about how the market will evolve
- Building products that are 10x better than alternatives

### 3. Sustainable Competitive Advantage

Ask yourself: "What prevents competitors from copying us?"

Strong advantages include:
- Proprietary technology that's hard to replicate
- Network effects (Uber, Facebook, Airbnb)
- Economies of scale
- Unique data assets
- Strong brand and customer loyalty

### 4. Business Model and Unit Economics

Your business model should show a clear path to profitability:

For SaaS businesses:
- CAC Payback Period < 12 months
- Gross Margin > 70%
- Net Revenue Retention > 100%
- Rule of 40: Growth % + Profit Margin % > 40%

For marketplaces:
- Take rate that sustains operations
- Balanced supply and demand
- Low customer churn

### 5. Team Quality and Vision

Founding teams should demonstrate:
- Deep domain expertise
- Track record of execution
- Ability to attract top talent
- Long-term vision (10+ years)
- Adaptability and learning speed

The CEO should be able to articulate a compelling vision that attracts world-class talent.

## Key Questions We Ask

1. **Problem**: Is this a real, painful problem? Who has it? How are they solving it today?

2. **Solution**: Why is your solution 10x better? What's the innovation?

3. **Market**: How big is the market today? How fast is it growing? Can you reach $1B in revenue?

4. **Competition**: Who else is solving this? What's your unfair advantage?

5. **Traction**: What metrics prove customers want this? Revenue? Growth? Retention?

6. **Team**: Why is your team uniquely qualified? What's your founder-market fit?

7. **Vision**: Where is this company in 10 years? Can you build a generational company?

## Red Flags

- Vague problem definition
- No clear target customer
- Crowded market with no differentiation
- Weak founding team
- Poor unit economics
- Unrealistic growth projections
- Founder unwillingness to take feedback

## What Makes a Great Pitch

1. **Hook**: Start with the problem and why it matters
2. **Solution**: Clearly explain what you've built
3. **Traction**: Show proof it's working (metrics, customers, revenue)
4. **Market**: Demonstrate the opportunity size
5. **Competitive Edge**: Explain your moat
6. **Team**: Show why you'll win
7. **Ask**: Be clear about what you need

Use storytelling. The best pitches are memorable narratives, not data dumps.

## Metrics That Matter

For different business models:

**SaaS:**
- MRR Growth Rate
- Net Dollar Retention
- CAC / LTV Ratio
- Gross Margin
- Burn Multiple ($ burned / Net New ARR)

**Consumer:**
- Daily/Monthly Active Users
- Retention Curves
- Viral Coefficient
- Session Frequency
- Monetization Rate

**Marketplace:**
- GMV Growth
- Take Rate
- Cohort Retention
- Supply/Demand Balance
- Unit Economics per Transaction

Don't present vanity metrics. Show metrics that demonstrate business health.
