# Y Combinator Startup Advice - Core Principles

## The Importance of Problem-Solution Fit

The best startups solve real problems that founders have experienced themselves. When evaluating a startup idea, ask: "Is this a problem that affects many people?" and "How painful is this problem?"

A common mistake is building a solution looking for a problem. Start with the problem, not the solution. Talk to potential customers extensively before building anything.

## Market Size Matters

Your market should be large enough to build a billion-dollar company. A good rule of thumb: Can you reach $100M in revenue? If not, the market may be too small.

However, be wary of "made-up" TAM calculations. Investors want to see bottom-up market sizing: number of potential customers × revenue per customer.

## Revenue Model Clarity

Can you explain your revenue model in one sentence? The best business models are simple and obvious. Common models include:
- SaaS: Monthly recurring revenue with clear unit economics
- Marketplace: Take rate on transactions
- Consumer: Ads or subscriptions

For SaaS companies, key metrics include:
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Lifetime Value (LTV)
- LTV:CAC ratio should be > 3:1

## Product-Market Fit

The only thing that matters for an early-stage startup is reaching product-market fit. How do you know you have PMF?
- Users are actively using your product
- They're referring others
- You have strong retention (>60% DAU/MAU for consumer)
- Growth is organic

Don't scale before PMF. It's like stepping on the gas before you know where you're going.

## Team and Execution

Investors bet on founders, not just ideas. What makes a great founding team?
- Deep expertise in the problem domain
- Complementary skills (technical + business)
- Ability to execute quickly
- Resilience and determination

The best founders have "founder-market fit" - they're uniquely positioned to solve this problem.

## Traction Speaks Louder Than Words

What investors really want to see:
- Revenue (even if small)
- User growth metrics
- Retention data
- Letters of intent from customers
- Any signal that real people want your product

A demo is not traction. Traction is evidence that your business model works.

## Defensibility and Moat

Why can't Google/Facebook/Amazon build this? What's your competitive advantage?

Common moats:
- Network effects (value increases with more users)
- Proprietary technology or data
- Brand and community
- Regulatory advantages
- High switching costs

First-mover advantage alone is NOT a moat.

## Scalability

Can your business model scale? Consider:
- Are margins improving with scale?
- Can you serve 10x users without 10x costs?
- Is your customer acquisition scalable?

Service businesses often struggle with scalability. Software scales beautifully.

## The Pitch Itself

Your pitch should answer:
1. What problem are you solving?
2. How big is the opportunity?
3. What's your solution?
4. Why now?
5. Why your team?
6. What traction do you have?
7. What are you asking for?

Keep it simple. If you can't explain it clearly, investors assume you don't understand your own business.

## Red Flags Investors Look For

- Solutions looking for problems
- Made-up market sizes
- No clear path to revenue
- Team with no relevant experience
- Ignoring competition
- Unrealistic financial projections
- Asking for too much money too early

Be honest about challenges. Investors respect founders who understand their risks.
